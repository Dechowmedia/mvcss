# [MVCSS v3.0.2](http://mvcss.github.com)

## Compiling

If you want to compile MVCSS into an `application.css` (and `application.min.css`)
file, you'll need to do the following:

```shell
cd _build
npm install
```

And then run:

```shell
grunt build
```

You should now have a `css` directory at the root with the compiled CSS files.
